1) thExplain e relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
Answer=The "Product" and "Product_Category" entities are related through a foreign key relationship. In the "Product" table, there is a column named category_id, which is a foreign key referencing the id column in the "Product_Category" table. This indicates that each product in the "Product" table is associated with a specific category from the "Product_Category" table.
2)How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
Answer=To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can enforce the foreign key constraint. This constraint will ensure that the values in the category_id column of the "Product" table must match the values in the id column of the "Product_Category" table. This prevents the insertion of records into the "Product" table with invalid or non-existent category references.
Here's an example SQL statement to create the foreign key constraint:
alter table Product
add constraint FK_Product_Category
foreigen key (category_id)
references Product_Category(id);
3)Create schema in any Database script or any ORM (Object Relational Mapping).
Answer=
-- Create Product_Category table
CREATE TABLE Product_Category (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    modified_at TIMESTAMP,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP
);
-- Create Product_Inventory table
CREATE TABLE Product_Inventory (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    quantity INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    modified_at TIMESTAMP,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP
);
-- Create Discount table
CREATE TABLE Discount (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description VARCHAR(255),
    discount_percent DECIMAL(5,2),
    active BOOLEAN,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    modified_at TIMESTAMP,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP
);
-- Create Product table with foreign keys
CREATE TABLE Product (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description VARCHAR(255),
    sku VARCHAR(50),
    category_id INT,
    inventory_id INT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    discount_id INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    modified_at TIMESTAMP,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES Product_Category(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (inventory_id) REFERENCES Product_Inventory(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (discount_id) REFERENCES Discount(id)
);
